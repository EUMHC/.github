## About Us

This is the official GitHub organisation for Edinburgh University Men's Hockey Club. Here, you can find a selection of software projects written by current and former club members, directly for use at the club.

## Projects

Here are some of our key projects:

- **[BUCS Matches Website Display](https://github.com/EUMHC/website-bucs-matches):** Display BUCS fixtures and results on the club website. Written in vanilla JS.
- **[BuzzBot2](https://github.com/EUMHC/bb2):** A blazingly fast (sorta), disgustingly rigorous umpiring assignment system. Built in Python.
- **[PINTS.py](https://github.com/EUMHC/pints.py):** A RESTful API backend for the Performance Indicator Normalised Trend System. Built in Python.
